# Qubit Calculator
## Summary

## How to run
1) Make sure to have qiskit and qiskit-aer packages downloaded
2) Within the main.py file, change the values of the variables 'valueA', 'valueB', and 'operation'
3) Enjoy your output in the terminal!

For valueA and valueB, use an integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive), and for the operation, choose the character '+' or '-'
If you would like to run the first version of the calculator, uncomment the import for circuit_v1 and its function call, then comment out the import for circuit_v2 and its function call.
The code defaults to using circuit_v2. For the circuit_v1, the output will be in binary form and does require an operation field, it only supports addition.
